# TalentMine HR Document Table Extractor Codelab

## Introduction and Application Overview
Duration: 10:00

Welcome to the TalentMine HR Document Table Extractor Codelab! In this lab, you will explore a Streamlit application designed to simulate a core functionality of the TalentMine system: the extraction and semantic enrichment of tabular data from HR documents using Large Language Models (LLMs).

### What is TalentMine and Why is This Important?

The application is based on the concepts presented in the paper "TalentMine: LLM-Based Extraction and Question-Answering from Multimodal Talent Tables" [1]. TalentMine addresses a critical challenge in HR operations: extracting structured information from complex, often semi-structured, HR documents like benefits summaries, compensation matrices, and performance reviews.

Traditionally, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used to convert these documents into text. However, traditional OCR often struggles with tables, especially those with complex layouts, merged cells, or hierarchical structures. This leads to **significant information loss** and errors, making automated processing difficult.

**The key concept** demonstrated here is how LLMs, particularly powerful models like those in the Anthropic Claude family, can go beyond simple text extraction. By understanding the context and relationships within the document, LLMs can perform **semantic enrichment**, preserving the tabular structure and relationships (like which data belongs to which row and column), even when the visual layout is complex. This results in more accurate and usable extracted data.

<aside class="positive">
This application highlights the significant **business value** of using LLMs for document processing in HR. Improved accuracy in data extraction directly translates to:
- Faster and more reliable HR processes (e.g., payroll, benefits administration).
- Better data for analytics and decision-making.
- Reduced manual data entry and error correction costs.
- Enhanced compliance by accurately capturing details from policy documents.
</aside>

### Target Audience

This codelab is designed for:
*   Data scientists and engineers
*   HR professionals interested in HR Tech
*   LLM practitioners
*   Students exploring Document AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this codelab, you will be able to:
*   Understand the limitations of traditional methods for extracting tabular data from HR documents.
*   Grasp how LLMs can provide **semantically enriched** table data, preserving structure and context.
*   Compare the simulated performance of different extraction methods (Traditional OCR vs. various LLM simulations).
*   Understand the basic architecture of the provided Streamlit application.

### Application Features

The application includes the following simulated features:
*   **Synthetic Document Upload**: Select from pre-defined synthetic HR documents.
*   **Simulated Extraction Process**: View the raw output of 'traditional OCR' and the 'semantically enhanced' output of 'simulated LLMs'.
*   **Performance Comparison**: Visualize simulated accuracy and information loss metrics based on findings in the TalentMine paper.
*   **Interactive Parameters**: Select document types and simulated extraction methods to see their impact.

This lab serves as an intuitive demonstration of the advantages of LLM-based document processing, specifically in the context of complex HR documents, contrasting it with traditional approaches and quantifying the benefits through simulated metrics.

## Setting up the Environment
Duration: 05:00

To run the Streamlit application, you need Python installed. You will also need to install the required libraries.

1.  **Create Project Directory:**
    Create a folder for your project, e.g., `talentmine_codelab`.
    Inside `talentmine_codelab`, create another folder named `application_pages`.

2.  **Create Files:**
    Inside the `talentmine_codelab` folder, create a file named `app.py`.
    Inside the `application_pages` folder, create three files: `page1.py`, `page2.py`, and `page3.py`.

3.  **Copy the Code:**
    Copy the code provided for `app.py`, `application_pages/page1.py`, `application_pages/page2.py`, and `application_pages/page3.py` into their respective files.

4.  **Install Libraries:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the `talentmine_codelab` directory.
    Install the necessary libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas plotly kaleido
    ```

    -   `streamlit`: For building the web application interface.
    -   `pandas`: For handling tabular data (used in metrics page).
    -   `plotly`: For creating interactive plots (used in metrics page).
    -   `kaleido`: A dependency for exporting plotly figures, though not strictly required just for displaying in Streamlit.

5.  **Run the Application:**
    In your terminal, still inside the `talentmine_codelab` directory, run the Streamlit application:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    This will open the application in your web browser, usually at `http://localhost:8501`.

You now have the application running and are ready to explore its functionalities.

## Understanding the Navigation and Document Selection
Duration: 15:00

Let's explore the structure of the application and the first page (`page1.py`).

### Application Structure (`app.py`)

The main file `app.py` sets up the basic Streamlit page configuration, adds the title and sidebar elements, and controls the navigation between the different pages using the sidebar selectbox.

```python
import streamlit as st
st.set_page_config(page_title="TalentMine", layout="wide") # Sets page title and layout
st.sidebar.image("https://www.quantuniversity.com/assets/img/logo5.jpg") # Adds logo to sidebar
st.sidebar.divider() # Adds a divider
st.title("TalentMine") # Main title
st.divider() # Adds a divider
# ... markdown introductory text ...

# Navigation control using sidebar selectbox
page = st.sidebar.selectbox(label="Navigation", options=["Document & Method Selection", "Extraction Output", "Performance Metrics"])

# Import and run the selected page script
if page == "Document & Method Selection":
    from application_pages.page1 import run_page1
    run_page1()
elif page == "Extraction Output":
    from application_pages.page2 import run_page2
    run_page2()
elif page == "Performance Metrics":
    from application_pages.page3 import run_page3
    run_page3()

st.divider()
st.write("Â© 2025 QuantUniversity. All Rights Reserved.")
st.caption(...) # License caption
```

This structure allows for modularity, keeping the code for each page separate. The `st.session_state` object is implicitly used by Streamlit to maintain variables across different user interactions and page navigations within a single user session.

### Page 1: Document & Method Selection (`application_pages/page1.py`)

This page is responsible for allowing the user to select a synthetic HR document and the simulated extraction method. It also loads the corresponding synthetic data and stores the user's selections in `st.session_state` so they can be accessed by subsequent pages.

```python
import streamlit as st

def run_page1():
    st.sidebar.subheader("1. Select Document")

    # Dropdown for Document Type selection
    document_type = st.sidebar.selectbox(
        "Document Type",
        ["Benefits Plan", "Compensation Matrix", "Performance Review"],
        help="Choose a synthetic HR document type."
    )

    # Dropdown for Document Complexity selection (dependent on Document Type)
    complexity_options = {
        "Benefits Plan": ["Simple"],
        "Compensation Matrix": ["Hierarchical"],
        "Performance Review": [1]
    }
    complexity_level = st.sidebar.selectbox(
        "Document Complexity",
        complexity_options[document_type], # Populates options based on selected document_type
        help="Select the complexity level of the document."
    )

    # Store selections in Streamlit's session state
    st.session_state.document_type = document_type
    st.session_state.complexity_level = complexity_level

    # Function to load synthetic document data
    def load_synthetic_hr_document(document_type, complexity_level):
        """Loads synthetic HR document data."""
        synthetic_data = {
            ("Benefits Plan", "Simple"): {"document_type": document_type, "complexity_level": complexity_level, "data": ["PlanName: HealthPlus", "Coverage: Individual, Family", "Deductible: $500", "Premium: $100/month"], "table": "PlanName | Coverage | Deductible | Premium\nHealthPlus | Individual, Family | $500 | $100/month"},
            ("Compensation Matrix", "Hierarchical"): {"document_type": document_type, "complexity_level": complexity_level, "data": ["Role: Software Engineer L5", "SalaryRange: $120k-$180k", "BonusTarget: 15%", "EquityGrant: 500 units"], "table": "Role | Salary Range | Bonus Target | Equity Grant\nSoftware Engineer L5 | $120k-$180k | 15% | 500 units"},
            ("Performance Review", 1): {"document_type": document_type, "complexity_level": complexity_level, "data": ["Employee: Jane Doe", "Rating: Exceeds Expectations", "Comments: Strong leadership, met all goals.", "Goals: Lead new project by Q3"], "table": "Employee | Rating | Comments | Goals\nJane Doe | Exceeds Expectations | Strong leadership, met all goals. | Lead new project by Q3"}
        }
        return synthetic_data.get((document_type, complexity_level), None)

    # Load the selected document data
    document_data = load_synthetic_hr_document(document_type, complexity_level)
    st.session_state.document_data = document_data # Store data in session state

    st.subheader("2. Loaded Synthetic HR Document")
    if document_data:
        st.write("Simulated Document Data:")
        st.json(document_data["data"]) # Display simulated data
    else:
        st.warning("No synthetic document data available for the selected type and complexity.")

    # Function to validate dataset structure (simplified)
    def validate_dataset(data):
        """To confirm the structure and integrity of the loaded synthetic dataset."""
        if not data: return False
        if "data" in data and isinstance(data["data"], list) and len(data["data"]) > 0:
            return True
        return False

    # Validate and display status
    if document_data:
        is_valid = validate_dataset(document_data)
        st.markdown("### Validate Dataset")
        if is_valid:
            st.success(f"Dataset is valid for processing: {is_valid}")
        else:
            st.error(f"Dataset validation failed: {is_valid}. Data might be missing or malformed.")
    else:
        st.info("No document loaded to validate.")

    st.sidebar.subheader("3. Select Extraction Method")
    # Dropdown for Extraction Method selection
    extraction_method = st.sidebar.selectbox(
        "Simulated Extraction Method",
        ["Traditional OCR", "TalentMine (Claude v3 Haiku)", "AWS Textract", "AWS Textract Visual Q&A"],
        help="Choose an extraction method to simulate its output."
    )
    st.session_state.extraction_method = extraction_method # Store method in session state
```

**Flow of Page 1:**

1.  The user selects a "Document Type" and "Document Complexity" from the sidebar.
2.  These selections are stored in `st.session_state`.
3.  The `load_synthetic_hr_document` function is called to retrieve simulated data based on the selections. This function contains hardcoded synthetic examples of what data from different HR documents might look like, including a simplified text representation (`"data"`) and a structured table representation (`"table"`).
4.  The loaded `document_data` is stored in `st.session_state`.
5.  A simplified validation check is performed and displayed.
6.  The user selects a "Simulated Extraction Method" from the sidebar.
7.  This selection is also stored in `st.session_state`.

<aside class="positive">
Using <code>st.session_state</code> is a standard pattern in Streamlit applications to share data between different parts of the app, including different pages or functions, without relying on global variables. This makes the application stateful and interactive.
</aside>

At this point, the application has loaded simulated document data and determined which extraction method to simulate, storing these choices for the next page.

## Exploring the Extraction Output
Duration: 15:00

Now, navigate to the "Extraction Output" page using the sidebar. This page (`application_pages/page2.py`) simulates the output of different extraction methods based on the selections made on Page 1.

```python
import streamlit as st

def run_page2():
    # Check if required data is in session state
    if 'document_data' not in st.session_state or 'extraction_method' not in st.session_state:
        st.warning("Please select a document and extraction method on the 'Document & Method Selection' page.")
        return

    # Retrieve data and method from session state
    document_data = st.session_state.document_data
    extraction_method = st.session_state.extraction_method

    # Function to simulate Traditional OCR output
    def simulate_traditional_ocr_extraction(document_data):
        """Simulates traditional OCR extraction with potential errors."""
        if not document_data or "data" not in document_data:
            return ""

        text = ""
        # Simulate errors/poor structuring for OCR
        # This intentionally removes separators like ':' and '-' to mimic OCR errors
        for item in document_data["data"]:
            text += item.replace(":", " ").replace("-", " ") + " "
        return text.strip() + " (Simulated OCR errors may occur)"

    # Function to simulate LLM Enhanced Extraction output
    def simulate_llm_enhanced_extraction(document_data, llm_model_name):
        """Simulates LLM-based extraction, enriching data semantically."""
        if not document_data or not llm_model_name or "table" not in document_data:
            return "LLM extraction not applicable or data missing."

        # This simulation simply returns the pre-defined structured table data
        # A real LLM would analyze the document image/text and generate this structure
        if "table" in document_data:
            return f"**LLM Model: {llm_model_name}**\n\nExtracted Semantically Enriched Table Data:\n\n```\n{document_data['table']}\n```\n(Simulated preservation of row-column relationships and contextual dependencies)"
        else:
            return "No tabular data found for LLM extraction."

    st.subheader("3. Simulated Extraction Output")
    if document_data:
        # Display output based on selected method
        if extraction_method == "Traditional OCR":
            ocr_text = simulate_traditional_ocr_extraction(document_data)
            st.markdown("#### Raw OCR Output")
            st.code(ocr_text)
        else:
            # For any method other than "Traditional OCR", simulate LLM output
            llm_text = simulate_llm_enhanced_extraction(document_data, extraction_method)
            st.markdown(f"#### {extraction_method} Enhanced Semantic Output")
            st.markdown(llm_text)

        # Always show a comparison side-by-side if possible
        if extraction_method != "Traditional OCR":
            st.markdown("#### Comparison with Traditional OCR")
            col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
            with col1:
                st.markdown("##### Raw OCR Output")
                st.code(simulate_traditional_ocr_extraction(document_data))
            with col2:
                st.markdown(f"##### {extraction_method} Enhanced Output")
                st.markdown(simulate_llm_enhanced_extraction(document_data, extraction_method))

    else:
        st.info("Please select a document to see extraction output.")
```

**Flow of Page 2:**

1.  It first checks if `document_data` and `extraction_method` are available in `st.session_state`. If not, it prompts the user to go back to the first page.
2.  It retrieves the `document_data` and `extraction_method` from `st.session_state`.
3.  Based on the `extraction_method` selection, it calls either `simulate_traditional_ocr_extraction` or `simulate_llm_enhanced_extraction`.
    *   `simulate_traditional_ocr_extraction`: Takes the simulated text data (`document_data["data"]`) and intentionally removes formatting (like replacing `:` and `-` with spaces) to mimic the loss of structure often seen in raw OCR output from tables.
    *   `simulate_llm_enhanced_extraction`: Takes the simulated structured table data (`document_data["table"]`) and presents it as the output. **This function simulates the ability of an LLM to understand the document's content and reproduce the tabular information with its structure intact**, even if the raw OCR was messy. It highlights the "semantically enriched" aspect.
4.  The simulated output is displayed using `st.code` for raw text or `st.markdown` for formatted output.
5.  If an LLM-based method is selected, a side-by-side comparison is shown, displaying both the simulated raw OCR and the simulated LLM output for contrast.

<aside class="positive">
The side-by-side comparison is key to understanding the value proposition. Notice how the "Traditional OCR" output loses the clear association between key names (like "PlanName") and their values ("HealthPlus"), while the "LLM Enhanced Output" maintains this structure in a readable, tabular format. This visually demonstrates the **semantic enrichment** provided by the simulated LLM.
</aside>

This page effectively visualizes the difference in output quality between traditional OCR and the LLM-based approach, highlighting the preservation of tabular structure and context by the latter.

## Analyzing Performance Metrics
Duration: 20:00

Finally, navigate to the "Performance Metrics" page using the sidebar. This page (`application_pages/page3.py`) simulates the performance metrics (Accuracy and Information Not Found rate) for different extraction methods based on the reported results in the TalentMine paper [1].

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

def run_page3():
    # Check if required data is in session state
    if 'document_data' not in st.session_state:
        st.warning("Please select a document on the 'Document & Method Selection' page.")
        return

    # Retrieve data from session state
    document_data = st.session_state.document_data
    document_type = st.session_state.get('document_type', "Benefits Plan")
    extraction_method = st.session_state.get('extraction_method', "TalentMine (Claude v3 Haiku)")

    # Function to calculate simulated metrics based on document type and method
    def calculate_simulated_metrics(extracted_data_key, ground_truth_data, method_type):
        """Computes simulated accuracy and information not found rate based on predefined tables."""

            elif method_type == "Claude v3.5 Haiku": return {"accuracy": 0.80, "information_not_found": 0.00}
            elif method_type == "Claude v3.5 Sonnet v1/v2": return {"accuracy": 1.00, "information_not_found": 0.00}

1.  It checks if `document_data` is available in `st.session_state`.
2.  It retrieves `document_type` and `extraction_method` (though `extraction_method` is not directly used for the overall comparison plot on this page, it's available if needed).
3.  The `calculate_simulated_metrics` function is the core of this page. **It does NOT perform actual extraction or metric calculation.** Instead, it simulates the results based on hardcoded values, conceptually derived from the performance tables (Tables 1, 2, 5) presented in the TalentMine paper for different extraction methods and LLM models against a specific dataset (here, simulated as "Benefits Plan Data").
4.  It defines the mathematical formulas for Accuracy and Information Not Found rate using Markdown with LaTeX syntax ($...$ and $$...$$).
5.  It determines which set of simulated metrics to use based on the `document_type` selected. Currently, only "Benefits Plan" has corresponding simulated metrics.
6.  It compiles a list of methods to compare and iterates through them, calling `calculate_simulated_metrics` for each to get their simulated performance numbers.
7.  These numbers are stored in a pandas DataFrame (`df_metrics`).
8.  The DataFrame is displayed using `st.dataframe`.
9.  Two bar charts are created using `plotly.express`: one for Accuracy and one for Information Not Found rate, plotting the simulated results for all compared methods.
10. The charts are displayed using `st.plotly_chart`.
11. Finally, it includes a conclusion section summarizing the key takeaways and the license information.

The metrics displayed here are **simulated** based on the findings presented in the referenced paper [1]. They are intended to illustrate the *relative* performance differences between methods, particularly highlighting how LLM-based approaches (like TalentMine) can achieve higher accuracy and lower rates of missing information compared to traditional methods or other services like AWS Textract when dealing with complex tabular HR data.

This page provides a quantitative perspective (albeit simulated) on the benefits of using advanced LLM techniques for HR document table extraction, complementing the qualitative difference seen in the extraction output on Page 2.

## Experimenting and Concluding
Duration: 05:00

You have now walked through all the functionalities of the TalentMine HR Document Table Extractor simulation application.

### Experimentation

*   Go back to the "Document & Method Selection" page.
*   Try selecting different "Document Type" options. Observe how the "Document Complexity" options change (though limited in this simulation).
*   Select different "Simulated Extraction Method" options.
*   Navigate to the "Extraction Output" page. See how the simulated output changes based on the selected method. Pay close attention to the difference between "Traditional OCR" and the LLM-based methods.
*   Navigate to the "Performance Metrics" page. Observe the simulated accuracy and information not found rates. Note that currently, the metrics display is primarily driven by the "Benefits Plan" selection, as the `calculate_simulated_metrics` function has detailed lookups mainly for this type, based on the paper's focus.

### Connecting back to the Concepts

This simulation directly addresses the core problem outlined in the TalentMine paper: the limitations of traditional methods for extracting structured data from complex documents and how LLMs can overcome this by understanding semantic relationships.

*   Page 1 (Selection) sets the stage by simulating the input (a complex HR document) and the tools (different extraction methods).
*   Page 2 (Output) visually demonstrates the problem (messy OCR) and the solution (structured LLM output).
*   Page 3 (Metrics) provides a simulated quantitative justification for the LLM approach, showing better performance on key metrics like accuracy.

By interacting with these pages, you gain an intuitive understanding of the challenges in Document AI for complex layouts and the potential of LLMs to provide robust and accurate solutions, as explored in the TalentMine research.

<aside class="negative">
Remember that this is a **simulation**. The data is synthetic, and the extraction outputs and performance metrics are hardcoded based on the findings presented in the referenced research paper [1]. It does not perform real-time LLM calls or actual OCR. The purpose is to illustrate the concepts and demonstrate the potential benefits, not to provide a production-ready extraction tool.
</aside>

Congratulations on completing this codelab! You have successfully set up and explored a Streamlit application that simulates key aspects of LLM-based HR document table extraction, understanding the challenges and the value proposition of semantic enrichment.
